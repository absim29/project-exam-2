# Project Exam 2

**Holidaze** is a newly launched accommodation booking platform seeking a modern front-end solution to enhance user experience. This project focuses on developing a responsive and intuitive front-end application using the provided official API documentation.

The application encompasses two main components:

- **Customer-Facing Interface:** Users can browse, search for and book accommodations at various venues.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Venue managers can register, manage venue details, and view the venue bookings.

While the project adheres to specific API functionalities, the design and overall user experience are left to the developer's discretion, allowing for creative flexibility in crafting a user-friendly application.
